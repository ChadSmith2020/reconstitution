## Wear-a-Mask to Keep-us-Open Project

The Wear-a-Mask to Keep-us-Open project provides sign templates to educate people about the importance of wearing a mask to protect themselves and others from COVID-19. Download a PDF of [Wear-a-Mask to Keep-us-Open](https://github.com/ChadSmith2020/reconstitution/raw/master/publications/2020-0714-wear-a-mask.pdf) signs.

Next step for this project is to convert the mask source to Keynote or Powerpoint to make it easier for others to contribute. If you would like to contribute a sign, [create an issue](https://github.com/ChadSmith2020/reconstitution/issues) to describe the sign or publish it in a fork.
