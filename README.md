## Welcome to the 2020 Reconstitution project

The COVID-19 outbreak has devastated countless institutions, businesses, and lifestyles. The 2020 Reconstitution project publishes media and tools necessary to reconstruct institutions, economies and infrastructure as we reconstitute societies and civilization during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and aftermath.
