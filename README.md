## Wear-a-Mask to Keep-us-Open Project

The Wear-a-Mask to Keep-us-Open project provides sign templates to educate people about the importance of wearing a mask to protect themselves and others from COVID-19 and to inform them that it is State Law (where applicable) to do so. Download the PDF Signs with MIT License: [Wear-a-Mask to Keep-us-Open](https://github.com/ChadSmith2020/reconstitution/raw/master/publications/wear-a-mask.pdf)  Thank you for posting these signs.

If there is anything found to be offensive or inaccurate, please [create an issue](https://github.com/ChadSmith2020/reconstitution/issues).

Next step for this project is to convert the mask source to Keynote or Powerpoint to make it easier for others to contribute. If you would like to contribute a sign or other resource, [create an issue](https://github.com/ChadSmith2020/reconstitution/issues) or publish it in a fork.
