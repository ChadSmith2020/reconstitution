## Wear-a-Mask to Keep-us-Open Project

The Wear-a-Mask to Keep-us-Open project provides sign templates to educate people about the importance of wearing a mask to protect themselves and others from COVID-19 and to inform them that it is State Law (where applicable) to do so. Download the PDF of the signs here:
